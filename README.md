Hello, Iâ€™m Zain, a full-stack developer with a knack for creating dynamic user interfaces. Iâ€™ve honed my skills in server-side development using Node.js and C#, and have experience working with companies like GfK.

Beyond programming, Iâ€™m an effective communicator, able to convey my ideas efficiently. Iâ€™ve demonstrated my expertise in React, converted projects from JavaScript to Typescript, and created an ACH project on ASP.NET, saving profits by 15%.

Iâ€™m a lifelong learner, expanding my skill set by learning Rust. I hold a Bachelor of Science Honours in Software Engineering from Coventry University, UK, and have completed several relevant courses.

I look forward to bringing my problem-solving skills, dedication to quality, and passion for coding to your projects. Iâ€™m also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer, valuing the collaboration and knowledge sharing that happens through open-source.
