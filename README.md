Hey there, Internet traveler! 🚀 I'm Zain, your friendly neighborhood full-stack developer. I've got a knack for crafting dynamic user interfaces and server-side development using Node.js and C#. I've had the pleasure of working with some cool companies like GfK, bringing my problem-solving skills and dedication to quality to every project.

Beyond the world of code, I'm a communication wizard 🧙‍♂️, able to transform complex ideas into understandable concepts. I've demonstrated my expertise in React, waved my magic wand to convert projects from JavaScript to TypeScript, and even conjured up an ACH project on ASP.NET, which resulted in a 15% profit increase. 💰

I'm a lifelong learner, currently on a quest to master Rust. 📚 I hold a Bachelor of Science Honours in Software Engineering from Coventry University, UK, and have completed several relevant courses to further enhance my knowledge.

In addition to my professional work, I'm an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge sharing that happens through open-source. 🌐
